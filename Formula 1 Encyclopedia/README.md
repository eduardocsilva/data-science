# Formula 1 Encyclopedia

## 1. Synopsis

A small project that served as an introduction to the Streamlit library, offering a simple front-end from which Formula 1 data (e.g. drivers, teams, circuits, races, etc.) can be browsed.

At the moment, only driver stats are browsable, but in the future, more data can be added, bringing this project closer to what its name suggests.
