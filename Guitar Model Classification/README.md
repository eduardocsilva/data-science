# Guitar Model Classification

## 1. Synopsis

This project served as an introduction to Tensorflow and its JavaScript implementation, allowing the trained model to be integrated in React.js front-end application, which can be consulted in the following [repository](https://github.com/eduardocsilva/guitar-classification-tensorflow) and [website](https://eduardocsilva.github.io/guitar-classification-tensorflow).

The obtained deep neural network model is capable of processing an image and classifying the guitar contained in it, with a relatively low 60% accuracy, which can be improved by collecting more data/images for each of the guitar models and finer tuning of the neural network's architecture and training process.

- **Keywords:** Machine Learning, Classification, Neural Network, Deep Learning, TensorFlow.
