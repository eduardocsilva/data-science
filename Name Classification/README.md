# Name Classification

## 1. Synopsis

This project served as an introduction to PyTorch and RNN's (Recurrent Neural Networks). 

The obtained deep neural network is capable of classifying names according to their country's origin (e.g. the surname "Coelho" originated in Portugal). 

Furthermore, this projects shows how powerful RNN's can be when applied to Natural Language Processing.
