# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

Repository dedicated to data science and machine learning projects (e.g. ML models, notebooks, etc.)

For more information about each project, check each project's README or the respective synopsis below.

## 1. Projects

### 1.1. Book Recommendation System

Two Book Recommendation Systems, the first one based on the Cosine Simmilarity between books and the second one through collaborative filtering (still in development).

**Keywords:** Machine Learning, Clustering, Cosine Simmilarity, Collaborative Filtering.

**Technologies:** Python, Jupyter, Pandas, etc.

### 1.2. Formula 1 Encyclopedia

A small project that served as an introduction to the Streamlit library, offering a simple front-end from which Formula 1 data (e.g. drivers, teams, circuits, races, etc.) can be browsed.

At the moment, only driver stats are browsable, but in the future, more data can be added, bringing this project closer to what its name suggests.

**Keywords:** Data Exploration and Analysis, Web Application.

**Technologies:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas, etc.

### 1.3. Guitar Model Classification

This project served as an introduction to Tensorflow and its JavaScript implementation, allowing the trained model to be integrated in React.js front-end application, which can be consulted in the following [repository](https://github.com/eduardocsilva/guitar-classification-tensorflow) and [website](https://eduardocsilva.github.io/guitar-classification-tensorflow).

The obtained deep neural network model is capable of processing an image and classifying the guitar contained in it, with a relatively low 60% accuracy, which can be improved by collecting more data/images for each of the guitar models and finer tuning of the neural network's architecture and training process.

**Keywords:** Machine Learning, Classification, Neural Network, Deep Learning, TensorFlow.

**Technologies:** Python, Jupyter, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, etc.

### 1.4. User Review Classification

This project contains two user review classification models, the first for product categories (e.g. books, technology) and the second for the review's sentiment (e.g. positive, neutral or negative).

The classification is achieved through natural language processing techniques such as text tokenization and occurence/frequency analysis.

**Keywords:** Machine Learning, Classification, Natural Language Processing, Text Tokenization, Word Occurence/Frequency, Bag of Words.

**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc.
