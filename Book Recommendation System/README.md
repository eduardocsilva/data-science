# Book Recommendation System

## 1. Synopsis

This project includes two Book Recommendation Systems, the first one based on the Cosine Similarity between each book's content and characteristics, and the second one through collaborative filtering, a technique which, unlike the former, needs users to give ratings to the books they read, indicating if they liked it or not.

This way, a collaborative filtering recommendation system can recommend books that users may like, based on the ratings from users with a similar taste (e.g. if both user A and B like fantasy books and user B just read a new fantasy book that he loved, there's a high probability that user A might like it as well).

On the other hand, a content/characteristics based recommendation system can still be used when there aren't a lot of users and reviews on the platform, as it has all the required information _a priori_ to provide recommendations to a user based on the type of books they enjoyed.
