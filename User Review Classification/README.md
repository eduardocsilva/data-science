# User Review Classification

## 1. Synopsis

This project contains two user review classification models, the first for product categories (e.g. books, technology) and the second for the review's sentiment (e.g. positive, neutral or negative).

The classification is achieved through natural language processing techniques such as text tokenization and word occurence/frequency analysis.

- **Keywords:** Machine Learning, Classification, Natural Language Processing, Text Tokenization, Word Occurence/Frequency, Bag of Words.

* **Based on the following [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9Itm95JzL0), from Keith Galli.**

- **Reviews retrieved from the following [Amazon user reviews dataset](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html).**
