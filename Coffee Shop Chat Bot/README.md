# Coffee Shop Chat Bot

## 1. Synopsis

A simple Chat Bot, simulating an owner of a coffee shop. You can greet him, ask what's for sale and even ask him some jokes.

The chat bot is supported by a neural network that detects the topic of your sentence (e.g. greeting, asking what's for sale), through Natural Language Processing, and then selects an appropriate response.

## 3. Chat Execution

At the moment, I'm working on a React.js front-end application, where people can interact with the chat bot in a simple and user-friendly environment.

In the meanwhile, you can interact with the chat bot through a console interface by executing the following script:

```
python3 chat.py
```
